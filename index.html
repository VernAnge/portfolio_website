		Hi there my name is Vernon, I am a passionate software developer with a focus on solution driven projects. 
		My goal is to establish a network/community of like minded developers who will focus on solving real world problems to better society as a whole. 
		I am a bit of an all rounder with a focus on software solutions, doing a step by step analysis of the problem and then building a tailored solution. 
		Depending on what software or tools you are currently using I might not even need to build anything and just tweak your operations to meet your needs. 
		I can create applications in various languages, and I have the necessary project and financial management skills needed to see any project through to completion. 
		You have taken the initial step and landed on my page, now take the next step and get the solutions you need!</p>
